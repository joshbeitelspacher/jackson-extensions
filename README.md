Jackson Extensions
==================

**This project is now abandoned. The code has been moved to https://github.com/xebia/jackson-lombok by a new maintainer.**

This repository contains extensions for [Jackson][1].

The ConstructorPropertiesAnnotationIntrospector allows Jackson to deserialize classes with constructors that are annotated with [java.beans.ConstructorProperties][2].  This is very helpful when working with classes generated by [Lombok][3].
